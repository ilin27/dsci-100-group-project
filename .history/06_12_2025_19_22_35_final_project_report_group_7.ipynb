    "## **Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background information:** \n",
    "- Frank Wood, an associate professor of computer science at UBC, is leading a research group in learning about players' actions in a MineCraft server that they have created. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "- One question they asked was: **\"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\"**\n",
    "- Our group is interested in answering the following question: **\"Can the number of hours the players spend on the server (played_hours) and the age of the player (Age) predict if a player will subscribe (subscribe) to a game-related newletter based on the players.csv dataset?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset description:**\n",
    "- We will be using the players.csv dataset.\n",
    "- There are 196 observations in this dataset.\n",
    "- The dataset contains the following variables: **experience** (one of Amateur, Regular, Pro, Veteran), **subscribe** (whether or not a player subsribes to the newsletter), **hashedEmail** (player email), **played_hours** (hours player spent on the MineCraft server), **name** (player name), **gender** (one of Male, Female, Non-binary, Agender, Two-Spirited, Prefer not to say), **Age** (player age).\n",
    "- We will be focusing on the following variables for our analysis: **Age**, **played_hours**, **subscribe**."

    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The majority of observations (points on the graph) lie within the range of ages 10 to 30, which indicates this age subset of the population is more likely to engage with video game activities.\n",
    "- There is a higher proportion of subscribed gamers in this dataset as opposed to unsubscribed. This could mean that the likelyhood of a person playing video games could have a positive correlation with subscription status.\n",
    "- As the amount of hours recorded gaming in the observations increase, the subscribed observations dominates. This predicts a positive correlation between the amount of hours spent on the server and the respective player's subscription status.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analysis and the final visualization provide some deeper insight into the relationship between the two quantitative variables, Age and Played Hours. The analysis also included Subscription Status (qualitative) as the third variable. The visualization was helpful for observing the relationship between the three variables that the data analysis found.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the final visualization above, there are a few **key observations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The majority of the observations were predicted as TRUE (has subscribed) even though roughly half of the observations have actually *not* subscribed (triangles).\n",
    "- The classifier seems to correlate that players that did not subscribe all have spent little time on the server (orange).\n",
    "    - There may be a weak positive correlation between hours played and subscription status. As hours_played increases, players tend to subscribe.\n",
    "- The correlation between age and subscription status is very weak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing these data analysis results to our expectations from exploratory analysis, the final plot between the three variables were similar to our expectations. As seen in Graph 1 in the exploratory analysis, we had expected a weak correlation between age and subscription status, and a possible positive correlation between hours played and subscription status.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this K-NN classification, it was observed that players who played less were difficult to classify into the respective groups. For this study, K-NN classification appears to be satisfactory, but it might provide more accurate results if additional variables were incorporated. For future research, we may consider including other variables, like level of experience, gender, etc., which may have greater impacts on predicting subscription status. Additional insights can be gathered from analyses of playtime data over the period before players subscribe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playtime's influence on subscription status suggests that increasing engagement levels could be important for getting new subscribers. Knowing this information, the developer can craft advertisements or create attractive in-game events to tailor for player retention so people spend a longer time on ther server. The developer can create incentives to draw in players who may be less inclined to join the server and are less likely to subscribe."
